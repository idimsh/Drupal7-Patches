Drupal7-Patches

Patches to Drupal7

Every change I do to the core of Drupal 7 will be placed here.

The patches are for extreme cases where a contibuted module can't solve it.

I don't know yet why I am not pushing those changes to Drupal comminity, if
someone proposes that I should, then give me a hand here.
